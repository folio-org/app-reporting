# app-reporting

Eureka app for the Reporting facility.

This consists only of
[`ui-ldp`](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-ldp)
and
[`mod-reporting`](https://github.com/folio-org/mod-reporting),
but must depend on
[`app-platform-minimal`](https://github.com/folio-org/app-platform-minimal)
to get a module that has the `search` interface.
("Minimal" also includes, among other things, `mod-tags`, `mod-password-validator`, `mod-notes` and `mod-scheduler`)
